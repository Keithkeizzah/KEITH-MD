## [5.3.1] - 2023-11-20

### Fixed

Wanakana will now report its version correctly, this was briefly incorrect in version `5.3.0`.

## [5.3.0] - 2023-11-19

### Added

Typescript definitions have been added üéâ

## [5.2.0] - 2023-09-30

### Fixed

The iteration mark `„ÄÖ` was considered punctuation due to where it lies in unicode (alongside other punctuation). This caused some oddities in Wanakana when splitting characters. Since `„ÄÖ` acts like a kanji character in words, it is no longer considered punctuation in Wanakana. See #163 for further discussion.

- `isKanji()` now returns true for `„ÄÖ`
- `isPunctuation()` now returns false for `„ÄÖ`
- `tokenize()` no longer splits on `„ÄÖ`
- `stripOkurigana()` no longer splits on `„ÄÖ`

## [5.1.0] - 2023-02-03

### Fixed

- `bind()` could be used on the same element multiple times
- `unbind()` now returns an element to its previous state (attributes etc)

### Changed

- `unbind()` removes the attributes that were added by Wanakana

## [5.0.2] - 2022-05-17

### Fixed

- `bind()` was ignoring useObsoleteKana & customKanaMapping options
- `ku` not converting immediately with `IMEMode`

## [5.0.!] - 2022-04-15

### Fixed

- Unpkg should now properly source the correct module for use in the browser as a script tag

## [5.0.0] - 2022-04-15

### Fixed

- When a custom mapping was provided in options and then a different one was given, we only replaced the mapping with the new one when a previous one did not exist. Now we will always replace the custom mapping when it changes. <https://github.com/WaniKani/WanaKana/pull/132>

### Added

- Support for converting some k-- constructions. <https://github.com/WaniKani/WanaKana/issues/126>
- Allow user to ignore converting long vowel mark in toHiragana. <https://github.com/WaniKani/WanaKana/issues/128>

### Changed

- The UMD build now only includes polyfills for browserslist defaults (> 0.5%, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR, not dead - at time of writing) which drops support for IE.
- Node support is now 12+ (though likely would continue to work fine on older versions)

## [4.0.2] - 2018-04-30

### Added

- react-native field in lib package.json

### Fixed

- corrected recent dates in changelog (2017 -> 2018)

## [4.0.1] - 2018-04-30

### Fixed

- stripOkurigana(): If the input has the same kana at different locations, such as 'Áî≥„ÅóÁî≥„Åó', the inner kana was stripped instead

## [4.0.0] - 2018-04-26

### Changed

- stripOkurigana() options are now `{ leading: Boolean, matchKanji: String }`

### Removed

- stripOkurigana() "all" option has been removed but can be easily reproduced via `[...text].filter(isKana)`

## [3.1.1] - 2018-03-26

### Fixed

- some versions of Android GBoard English keyboard entering 'n' followed by a consonant would block further conversion

## [3.1.0] - 2018-03-01

### Changed

- bind() now sets necessary attributes automatically (autocomplete, spellcheck etc)
- toKana() no longer converts zenkaku latin toKana now: ('ÔΩâÔΩçÔΩâ imi' => 'ÔΩâÔΩçÔΩâ „ÅÑ„Åø')
- toRomaji() extends vowels for katakana ch≈çonpu, IE: „Ç≤„Éº„É† => geemu, toHiragana() converts to hyphen => ge-mu
- toKana() **without** IME mode converts lone 'n' => '„Çì', 'nn' => '„Çì„Çì' _if no other chars present_
- isJapanese() now returns false for latin numbers (201) (still true for zenkaku ÔºíÔºêÔºë)
- tokenize() splits into finer categories, view API documentation and tests for full details
- rewrite of conversion methods to allow custom mapping adapters

### Added

- isJapanese and isRomaji now accept a second param, a regexp that will also pass the check
- global option romanization for toRomaji() (currently only 'hepburn' however)
- global option customKanaMapping for toKana()
- global option customRomajiMapping for toRomaji()

### Fixed

- inserting text between already existing characters in a bind() IME input field now properly sets cursor to correct position after conversion
- toRomaji() little „É∂„Éµ used in words like ‰∏Ä„É∂Êúà are no longer converted since they are used as symbols (like the kanji) and do not actually denote kana. Previous behaviour: ‰∏Ä„É∂Êúà => ‰∏Ä ke Êúà
- toRomaji() no longer incorrectly duplicates non-glottal stops following „Å£. Previous behaviour: „ÅÇ„Å£„ÄÅ -> a,,

## [2.3.4] - 2017-12-16

### Fixed

- _Uppercase_ input with toHiragana() including a double consonant was incorrectly producing a katakana „ÉÉ instead of „Å£

### Fixed

- Add https to unpkg link

## [2.3.2] - 2017-12-12

### Added

## [2.3.1] - 2017-10-17

### Changed

## [2.3.0] - 2017-08-28

### Added

- Handle multiple event listeners with separate options
- Increased test coverage

### Fixed
